We have implemented a multi-player board game with imperfect information
elements. The game also features an AI framework, which makes it
easy to add new AI algorithms. This provides an environment where
both new and existing algorithms can be compared.

By implementing several AI algorithms using the aforementioned framework,
we have verified that the designed API for AI algorithms is easy to use
and contains all the needed functionality.

In the experimental part of this thesis, we identified potential design flaws
in the game rules. Namely we speculate that players in earlier positions
have an advantage, much like the player going first has an advantage in Chess.
We also confirmed the hypothesis that the
ISMCTS algorithm is well-suited for solving games like \emph{Colonizers}.

Future work includes writing new AI algorithms for the game, and further
analysis of how balanced the game is.
